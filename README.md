# Email_Network_Analysis
This notebook is based on email network of a company. Data for this notebook has been downloaded from coursera. A node in this email network represents an employee. An edge in this network indicates that at least one email has been sent between two employees. Additionally each node has two attributes - department of employee and whether an employee receives management salary or not. In part I of this notebook we train a classifier to predict if an employee receives management salary or not. The features used in this model are the different centrality measures of a node and the department of an employee (represented by a node). Area under the ROC curve is used as evaluation metric here.
In part II of this notebook we train a classifier to predict if two nodes that are not connected at a certain point of time, will form a connection later. We use features like shortest distance between two nodes and number of common neighbors of two nodes. Again, area under the ROC curve is used as evaluation metric.
